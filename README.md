- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kanokoaomi
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming since I've started to play in computer games. I also like painting and drawing which gives me an opportunity to create my own games by myself!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JS and other technologies to to delve deeper into the programming topic.
- (But then I want to try C# as long it uses in creating games)
- ðŸ˜„ My actual full name is to hard to pronounce so just call me Lisa or Aomi :)
- âš¡ Fun fact: my first try to write a script was in Roblox Studio, when I was a kid with no knowledge haha
